# PDF-and-RAG-QA-System
A PDF-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that extracts content from uploaded PDFs, stores it in ChromaDB, and allows users to ask questions about the document. Google Gemini API is used for content generation, and the interactive interface is built with Gradio. The project is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
